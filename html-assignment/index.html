        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Sophia Hannah Vardy. I was born June 10<sup>th</sup> 2004. I was raised in Toronto and am the youngest of a family of 6. I <em>love</em> traveling and have spent the last two years traveling through Europe. I also enjoy photography and have many pictures capturing the moments of my travels. <br>

    <p> Some of my favorite places I have traveled to are Italy, Spain, and <abbr title="British Columbia">BC</abbr>. The views were breathtaking, and the food was absolutely incredible. One quote that has motivated me to travel is: 

      
        <blockquote>Travel, because money comes back to you, but your time won't. -<cite>Unknown</cite></blockquote>
