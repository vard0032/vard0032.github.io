        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Sophia Hannah Vardy. I was born June 10 <sup>th</sup> raised in Toronto and am the youngest of a family of 6. I <em>love</em> traveling and have spent the last two years traveling through Europe. I also enjoy photography and have many pictures capturing the moments of my travels.

    <p> Some of my favorite places I have traveled to are Italy, Spain, and <abbr title="British Columbia">BC</abbr>. The views were breathtaking, and the food was absolutely incredible. One quote that has motivated me to travel is the one stated below:

       <blockquote>Travel, because money comes back to you, but your time won't. -<em>Unkown</em></blockquote></p>
